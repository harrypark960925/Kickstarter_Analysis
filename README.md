## Overview of Project

Perfomed an analysis on Kickstarter data based on the launch date and the goal budget. By creating the graphs at last, the results can be clearly seen in the set range. 

## Analysis and Challenges

From year 2009 to 2017, I have extraced the data outcome whether it was successful, failed, or canceled for each month on theater. By putting the right field name on the right place for the pivot table, the line graph was created beside the pivot table. 

By setting the range for goal budget, I have calculated the percentage successful, failed, and canceled of plays. By counting the number successful, failed, and canceled (there were no canceled plays), I computed the number of total projects and divided into percentage. Then, I have created the graph the outcomes based on the goals. Looking at the horizontal axis of the graph, one can see the range of the goal. 

While creating the pivot table for the launch date, it was a bit tricky on the part where I have to locate the field in the right place. However, it was lucky that I have put each category on the right place on rows and columns. Also, there were some errors while I was writing countif() function becasue I missed placing " " for each range, but soon figured it out. 

## Results

- Looking at the line graph, one can claerly see there were significant successful outcomes in May, and as it goes to the end of the year, the number of outcomes of success and failures meet at the similar point. In October, no theater has been canceled, and there are very low outcomes of theater being canceled throughout the years. 
- One of the outcomes that one can see from the graph is when the goal was in the range of $45,000 to $49,999, it was 100% successful. 

- The limitation of this data set is that we focused on parent category theater for launch date and subcatergory for goals. We haven't combined parent category and subcategory together.  

- Line graphs are easy to look and analyze the results right away but creating a histogram could be another option to look at the graph easily.
